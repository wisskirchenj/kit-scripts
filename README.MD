# My Repo for Script Kit scripts.

This repository contains my (probably fast growing :grin:) collection of automation scripts using [John Lindquist's Script Kit](https://scriptkit.com/).

## Repository Contents

Mainly the scripts-folder (i.e. the subfolder of my `.kenv`).  
Besides some configuration files

## Progress

07.02.23 Repo setup. First version of a (to me) very useful `find-code` script, that lets me
- enter search string and amount of context (in lines) surrounding the result in display
- find occurrences of that search over all my Java-projects
- display the search results nicely in a scrollable panel with filepaths as headings
- (after hitting return in above panel) displays a chooser dialog from which each search hit's associated project can be opened on click
